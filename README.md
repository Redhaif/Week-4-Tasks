This is the README file for week 4 tasks which is adding a chatbot using Watson to my website. <br />
You will find in the folder: <br /> 
1- A public folder that contains the html files. <br /> <br />
2- A video folder that contains a video that shows the database is working using Firebase. <br />
3- A Json file for the IBM Watson I created.


Thanks for reading. <br />
